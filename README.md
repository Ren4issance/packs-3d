# 3D Card Pack Opening Experience

![Pack Opening Demo](https://github.com/Ren4issance/packs-3d/assets/34111582/your-future-demo-image-id)

An immersive and interactive 3D card pack opening experience built with React Three Fiber, Next UI, and TypeScript. This project demonstrates advanced 3D animations and interactions in a web browser, providing a realistic simulation of opening a pack of cards.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Realistic 3D Pack Opening Animation**: Smooth animations with controlled timing for opening packs
- **Interactive Card Reveal Sequence**: Cards are revealed one by one with dramatic animations
- **Card Inspection**: Examine cards up close with intuitive 3D rotation controls
- **Different Card Rarities**: Visual effects that distinguish between common, rare, and legendary cards
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Physics-Based Animation**: Natural-feeling animations with realistic physics
- **Touch & Mouse Controls**: Intuitive controls for both touch and mouse input

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ren4issance/packs-3d.git
cd packs-3d
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

## üß™ Key Code Examples

### Pack Opening Animation

```tsx
function Pack({ opened, setOpened }: PackProps) {
  // Animation logic for the pack opening
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    if (opened) {
      // Opening animation logic
      const openingProgress = Math.min(
        (state.clock.elapsedTime - animationStartTime) / openingDuration,
        1
      );

      // Position and opacity animation based on progress
      packGroupRef.current.position.y = THREE.MathUtils.damp(
        packGroupRef.current.position.y,
        openingProgress * -5,
        10,
        delta
      );

      // More animation logic...
    }
  });

  // Component rendering...
}
```

## üß© Advanced Features

### Card Rarity System

The project includes a system for different card rarities, each with unique visual effects:

- **Common Cards**: Standard cards with basic styling
- **Rare Cards**: Enhanced glow effects and subtle particle emissions
- **Legendary Cards**: Premium animated backgrounds and prominent visual effects

### Physics-Based Animation

Using Three.js physics helpers, cards have natural movement with realistic physics:

- Gravity affects how cards fall
- Collisions between cards create realistic bouncing
- Air resistance adds subtle motion to floating cards

## üîß Configuration

You can customize various aspects of the pack opening experience:

- Animation timing
- Physics properties
- Visual effects
- Card designs

Modify the constants at the top of `src/components/pack-opening.tsx` to adjust these parameters.
